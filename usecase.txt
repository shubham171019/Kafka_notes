Log Aggregation: 
Kafka can be used to centralize and aggregate logs generated by different components of a monolithic application. Instead of each component writing logs to separate files or databases, they can publish log events to Kafka topics. This allows for centralized log collection, analysis, and monitoring.


Microservices Migration: 
If you are in the process of migrating from a monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture, Kafka can act as a communication backbone between the different microservices. By integrating Kafka into the monolith, you can start decoupling components by publishing events to Kafka and having microservices consume those events.
